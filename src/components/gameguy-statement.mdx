<ins>A statement from gameguy:</ins>
<div style="padding-left: 1rem">

    Hi guys, gameguy here to write about how Carly made me protect her honor by taking blame for multiple things like tricking bekzii and croissant into thinking that I was the one to own the OffTopicGC Discord account, she had me fake multiple screenshots of her accusing me of owning the account all while I was blissfully unaware of what I was doing, the OffTopicGC account was previously used for (if I remember what she said correctly) pretending to be a doxxer called diparonasui. Obviously this may NOT be all correct but is all that I can recall due to it being rather a long time ago. She also was able to PERFECTLY impersonate me on the otgc Twitter account. Right here.

    This was ALSO carly, no input from me to do this because I was asleep when these messages were sent

    I know I am agreeing in the screenshot but I wasn't in the right mind to make these choices, it genuinely makes me sick to my stomach that we did this to Marble

    This one needs a bit of context, Micheal white is a transphobic "super straight guy" that carly, temporalist, and I met a while back, this is what carly is trying to say michael (non homophobic, overall a friendly and nice guy) is:

    She hadn't even heard his voice at that time.

    My name is Will and that's it for now!
    See ya!
