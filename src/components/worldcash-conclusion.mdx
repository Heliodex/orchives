I am gravely disappointed in 608's response to the accusations brought up against her. She should have realized the mistake she made and worked to correct the wrong she has done, but the only thing she did was spread lies about me and everyone else accusing her.

The reason I have made this document is to clear up any and all misconceptions on the matter. If I have gotten anything wrong or left out anything in this post, let me know.

I do not hate 608, but I cannot support her actions. As an individual she has caused harm that she has not shown remorse for, and I cannot accept that.

And 608, if you're reading this, hiding the truth won't help you at all. You are who you are, and you make mistakes. It's time to own up to them, and spread a proper counter argument instead of spreading lies and misinformation.

If people think you are a pedophile even after you tell them your counter argument, then you cannot convince them. You have made a grave mistake, and a grave mistake does not come without punishment. Accept that, or you will never move on.

If you did actually feel remorse I would expect you to say "I understand why you think I'm a pedophile, what I did was wrong and I don't expect you to forgive me" if someone doesn't believe in you, not post false information.

Don't even think about suicide either, that's just another form of escape. Realize how you were wrong and grow up. Do not harm other people for the sake of your own goals. What you did was wrong and you have to properly deal with that.

**Reminder: do not attack her for what she did.** This document was made to avoid the confusion she has spread everywhere, to tell 608 that what she did was wrong and nothing I have seen has changed that, to tell her that she has not dealt with the situation properly, and to tell her that none of the actions she has made throughout this have shown me any remorse for her actions whatsoever.

Remember, no one is forced to forgive you for what you did, 608. Tell the truth while defending yourself, as you know you did something wrong.

That is all. I will update this document if any new information comes to light.
