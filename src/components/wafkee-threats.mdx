**<ins>Update:</ins> A new image has shown what 608 has deleted above. Originally the bottom message (the message she deleted) was not in the above image, but it has been found within a new image, which has been put above, replacing the old one.**  
Context: Wafkee said "if you call me a traitor i'm gonna block everyone" in OTGC after I posted my response. (Evidence in image below)

As you can see, 608 is not very happy about Wafkee's choice to tell me about her lies.

608 said this to Wafkee, and then deleted it. The image attached to her message refers to a part of my document where I told her that suicide is not the answer to her problems. (Refer to "Conclusion" to find the exact place I said it.)

Wafkee was very upset by this. He was freaking out because of it and told me about what you said, and he was genuinely worried that you were going to do this.

She then said she's sorry for the message she deleted, but I doubt that considering the fact she has attempted to threaten Wafkee to do multiple things for her by saying she will commit suicide if he doesn't in the past. That is not acceptable behaviour. That is abusive. She also deleted it, which shows she is attempting to hide the fact she said it. She deleted the other instances of suicide threatening too.

There is no "just end and everyone be friends again". Do you think people could just easily forget about this? You haven't proven anything I said wrong. If things did go back to the way they were, it would feel off. No one but you would like that.

As for the top image, Wafkee did not ruin your life, 608. You did. This entire document is the truth, told from the best of my ability. What Wafkee told me about is the truth, and you did in fact attempt to manipulate him into believing that I wanted you doxxed.

Wafkee was not happy to hear this from you. He was scared, but not anymore.

I am heavily disappointed in you, 608. Your behaviour up until now has proven everything to me. You are a bad person and need to grow up. Take responsibility for your actions.

If you do anything to Wafkee, it will be added to this document.
