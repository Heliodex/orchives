	As a person, I've always tried to shy away from this type of "expose" thing, as I feel it's always caused unnecessary drama, but this is something I cannot ignore.

    608 has continuously manipulated others for her own gain, and although she has explained to me and others before that she doesn't have other people to talk to other than OTGC and has issues with mental health, that does not excuse her behavior whatsoever.

    An example of this was her manipulation of gameguy in order to stay in a relationship with him, due to her "fear of being kicked from OTGC", as she said in DMs with me when I confronted her.

    Perhaps 608 is right in her defense in which she says she is not a pedophile, and perhaps she really isn't interested in 13 year olds, but regardless, she is a groomer, and that is a fact. She manipulated gameguy, a 13 year old, to stay in a relationship with her because of her own goals.

    This was the last straw for me, and I cannot facilitate her constant manipulation anymore.

    Another argument she made is that it's not illegal because she is 17 and they were both minors. No. This is a 3.5 year age gap, 608. 13 year olds are not as developed as 17 year olds. Regardless of legality, you should not be doing this.

    She also attempted to ask me how I know she is 17. I know you're 17, 608. You said it before. Evidence is provided in the evidence section.

    She also did the same to a person named "Marble" (aliases include Neek, qunjz, Cukesim, etc.), and convinced gameguy to help her in manipulating him to think she still loves him, despite her disinterest in him. She did this because of Marble's continuous attempts of trying to force ownership of OTGC to be transferred himself, causing her to lose interest in him.

    Regardless of her reasoning for this, this is wrong. She should have told him directly that she was not interested in him. She made it look like gameguy was the one making the arguments by telling gameguy to say the things she wanted to say to him.

    The only reason she ended up telling him was because I gave her a time limit to do so (a week) after hearing many people in OTGC seem distraught about it, including gameguy.

    Marble ended up finding out beforehand though, and thus ended up not liking OTGC due to that, despite attempts at trying to reconcile with him in a GC. He still did not know gameguy was told to do what he did by 608 until months later.

    Marble did many bad actions towards 608/OTGC. I cannot deny that. However, luckily, lately he has listened to my advice to cease the actions that he was doing. He does not defend some of his actions, although other actions he did, like creating documents/videos on her, are completely understandable.
