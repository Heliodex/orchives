## This document goes over about Carly grooming, manipulating, and gaslighting people.

### <ins>Notice</ins>

There are multiple users mocking, harassing, and doxxing Carly because they hate her. The main author of this document (Marblyn) is not participating in this. If there's any visible personal information added here (there's more people with edit access listed at the end of the doc) please send an edit request (I will not accept edits) and I will remove that information.

#### Recent Notes & Changes

Well, it's been a while, huh? The document hasn't been updated in February (well at that point there were small updates to the document).

For those that have seen worldcash's now deleted document, thanks for finding this one. This document has TONS of evidence to prove Carly is a manipulative pedophile.

[ Draft ]

<span style="font-size:1.2rem">

## Police report updates

We have made police reports on Carly. Here are the updates below.

### 1/11/2023

An FBI tip has been made on Carly. If you are reading this and are from the FBI, please give appropriate punishment to Carly. I called her grandmother once and she refused to give proper punishment, so I had no choice but to file a report.

### 1/20/2023

I (Marble) couldn't wait any longer. Carly still uses the internet to do all of the below (aka, all of the chapters). I have submitted a Cybertip report on Carly. Let's hope they respond quicker.

### 6/12/2024

It's been a year, and Carly is dating Uyko privately. I have called the police department.

This part is still a draft, awaiting updates.

<strong style="color:#90f">
	If you are a relative of Carly (who is also known as C\*\*eb in real life),
	please do take action on her. She has damaged my miental health and others
	mental health with her manipulative actions. You should scroll and read

# Who is 608?

608 is a well-known member in the Gummib√§r community, as a controversial person. She's also in the Old Roblox Community, a community full of worse people, and a dangerous community to stay in.<sup id="[2]">[[2]](#additions)</sup>

She's also a (former?) voice actor of a well-known object show, RTTMOT. And also a known Whirled (Club) user.

# Statement against 608

<WorldcashStatement />

<ins>**Marble's statement**</ins>
<div style="padding-left: 1rem">
	Ever since me and Carly broke up (in August), she's been doing much more horrible things online, manipulating people into attacking me. I've tried so many ways to avoid her and her friends, they just wouldn't leave me alone, so I had to take actions into my own hands and create chapter one and three. She has easily dodged Chapter 1, but I had to make sure everyone knew about Chapter 2. She has done too many things to the point 2 more chapters (3 and 4) were added as she manipulated a 12 year old girl and tried to get Croissant to back her up, using shitty statements that could probably be not worth it anymore.

    So yeah, please, stop being fed with bullshit.

    <span style="color:#666;font-size:1.3rem">"The Document is FAKE!!"</span>

    No. It's not fake. Carly has attempted to get away with her actions for quite a while now. She has easily dodged the first chapter, but there are many more than Chapter 1. Please read the entire document before immediately jumping to conclusions.

    **She's currently gaslighting people to side with her. Everyone in her revivals are on her side. Go to Chapter 6 for more info.**

</div>

---

# Chapter 1: Manipulation & Backstabbing

Note that Carly has easily dodged this chapter. I recommend read the other chapters, since they include more and serious information. Carly successfully manipulated her friends in this chapter being fake. No, it's not fake.

So that being said, read this chapter if you want. The rest of the chapters contain more and serious information.

A lot of people assumed I made this document because she broke up with me. She broke up with me in the most harsh way possible. Again, the rest of the chapters include more urgent information unlike this one.

## Relationship Issues

### Info

Carly randomly started saying things like "Marble is hot" in Revolution Hill, and OffTopicGC a few times. I didn't think she would like me, this was like two or three months after I was added to OTGC. I was good friends with Carly and everyone else.

In May, I was removed from OTGC for constantly flirting with Carly in the group chat, and for attempting to get gameguy removed several times for power abuse.

In July, I started wrecking the OTGC domain because nexo and gameguy kept trying to communicate with me when I constantly asked them to stop, she said "you're hurting me by doing this". Moments after, she started ghosting my DMs because she was trying to "stay quiet about this".

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/1.png")} alt="" />

What caused me to break up you may ask?  
So... On 16 August 2022, GBA and Carly decided to tell me that gameguy, yakova, and nexo was threatening Carly with her house address. But guess what? It was all faked. Days after the drama ended, yakova made some "wiki page" on me, saying that I was being ignorant.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/2.png")} alt="" />

### Slight Pedophila

<strong style="color:red">
	NOTE THAT THIS PART IS NO LONGER ACCURATE FOR GAMEGUY, PLEASE DISREGARD THIS
	PART FOR HIM AND READ CHAPTER 2 IN THIS DOCUMENT.
</strong>

As of I am writing on this document, Carly is currently dating yakova and gameguy.

I don't have a problem with her dating gameguy, but yakova? That's not good. Keep in mind that:

-   Yakova is **14 years old**
-   Carly and gameguy are <strong style="color:#c82222">17 years old</strong>.

I don't mind poly relationships, but a 17 and a 14 year old? Hell no. It's not a "2 year age gap" either. Carly and gameguy was born in 2005 while yakova was born in 2008, which is a huge problem. I could say this is pedophila, but it isn't. But you might ask, why did she date Jared while he was 12?

Jared said that he was 15 years old in OTGC. Mysteriously, he told everyone in OTGC that he was actually 12 this entire time after he turned 13. This doesn't count as pedophila, because Carly didn't know about this, but she **KNOWS** that **yakova is 14 years old**, while <strong style="color:red">her and gameguy are 17</strong>. This is not a good thing. They are still dating each other.

When they both turn 18, they're going to have to stop dating, because if they both turn 18, it's gonna be legitimately illegal to date a 15 year old while being 18. That's just really bad.

UPDATE: Yakova has broken up with Carly and Gameguy

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/3.png")} alt="" />

## Drama

### "Address Threatening"

Oh boy. Here we go.

Remember when I said that Carly and GBA lied to me about the "address threatening"? Let me recap over the drama.

It started when gameguy bought otgc.pw (because I own offtopicgc.pw)

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/4.png")} alt="" />

Then moments after, Carly yet again backstabbed me when I trusted her.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/5.png")} alt="" />

Both Frostskeri and gameguy being a bitch (cockadooldo is gameguy):

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/6.png")} alt="" />

Oh and what do you know:

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/7.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/8.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/9.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/10.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/11.png")} alt="" />

Moments later, I was added to a group chat where Frostskeri and Carly tried to be honest with me that the drama was fake. I was so heartbroken that Carly did this to me. She had no right to do this to me.

(i changed my username to ",,,,,,," because I was really upset about the drama)

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/12.png")} alt="" />

After I've seen these messages, I was really upset, and I finally decided to breakup with Carly for doing this to me.

Relephonus decided to invite Carly to the Entity Overflow group chat after I removed her, and she tried her best to apologize to me:

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/13.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/14.png")} alt="" />

A day after, I decided to fire both Carly, GBA, and Alonso from Entity Overflow for what they've done to me (alonso was removed for a different reason, not for the backstabbings)

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/15.png")} alt="" />

That's where the drama ends. But that's not it though.

<br />

### "PLEASE FORGIVE ME!!!"

Carly just won't leave me the fuck alone after the address threatening drama. She has attempted to forgive me too many times, but she KNOWS that im not forgiving her for what she's done to me. Infact, I'm not forgiving anyone. I only forgave GBA because he never hated me. He considered me as a really good friend, and I barely gotten into any drama with him.

She started off by re-listing a video I asked her to take down (because the Old Roblox Community wouldn't leave me alone about the video, I see literally nothing bad about it)

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/16.png")} alt="" />

We had an entire argument on her shitty alt on Twitter about this. I don't have the tweets anymore because I pruned my tweets (because of some stupid drama I got into), but I'll give you guys an update if I have them again.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/17.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/18.png")} alt="" />

After a little argument in the comments section of the video, Carly privated the video. Knowing her, she's gonna do something else in the future. This drama isn't done yet.

### After gameguy and Carly broke up

<GameguyStatement />

# Chapter 2: Pedophila & sexual messages towards minors

**Carly has been doing sexual things towards minors on multiple occasions.** We are going through the incident that she groomed gameguy and will talk about how she said sexual things in public servers.

## Proof that she is 17

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/24.png")} alt="" />

She did not deny "becuz ur 17]". This was one day before the breakup. (The breakup happened on 11 October 2022.)

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/25.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/26.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/27.png")} alt="" />

Above is proof that she turned 17 on 17 September 2022.

## Update 1 October 2023

Carly has recently been caught dating another minor. She turned 18 RECENTLY. And is dating a 14 year old. People should really consider listening to Neek next time.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/a0.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/a1.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/a2.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/a3.png")} alt="" />

Flameboy's confrontation

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/a4.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/a5.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/a6.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/a7.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/a8.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/a9.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/a10.png")} alt="" />

## The point in which she knew gameguy's age

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/28.png")} alt="" />

She said "i wouldnt". This one is obvious. She was 16 during this exchange. However, they continued dating until 11 October 2022. She turned 17 within that timeframe, and yet still continued to date him. According to 608 when I confronted her, she did not like him anymore after he admitted this.

Whether you wish to believe her is up to you, but either way you look at it, it is either that she is a pedophile if she did like him, or that she is a groomer if she did not like him, due to the fact she kept dating him regardless and manipulated him into staying in the relationship.

## The breakup

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/29.png")} alt="" />

Above is the breakup with gameguy that I mentioned before. It happened on 11 October 2022, almost a month after she turned 17.

_She also did this to some other people, mostly VMware. VMware wanted to move on from Carly and Carly said this and that she wouldn't take down her harassment server if he didn't agree to be her friend. (This has nothing to do with the gameguy drama, this is from 2023)_

> <ins>**Gameguy note:**</ins>
> <br />
> "almost a month after she turned 17" I planned to break up on her birthday but
> that seemed really cruel so uh yeah

## The Confrontation

The dating was known very well in OTGC. Some people thought it was a joke, others did not. However, no one at the time realized that gameguy was 13. Most of them thought he was 15/17, except 608, who knew that he was 13 on 17 August 2022.

Then gameguy told me his age, and Official B confirmed it as a witness to his birth certificate. As a person, I should have done something about it at this point, as I knew 608 was 17, but I stayed silent. I didn't want to cause drama.

On the day of 12 October 2022, one day after the breakup, gameguy talked to Marble about it. Marble was obviously disgusted, as he thought gameguy was 15 beforehand. Seeing him disgusted made me wake up to the issue at hand, realizing that allowing 608 to get away with this is not an option. 608 does not show any actions that display remorse. She did not tell gameguy in any way "I'm sorry for dating you" (Update: She said it after this document was released, read "Response to 608's Response" for more information).

I decided it was time to confront 608 about this. Or well, Marble did, after hearing my reluctance to talk about it publicly. Marble told us he had a GC with her in it still in his DM history, and thus invited me and gameguy to it.

608 did not talk in that GC at all. Instead, she jumped straight into my DMs, asking me what she did. This is the DM history taken from that talk.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/30.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/31.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/32.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/33.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/34.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/35.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/36.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/37.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/38.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/39.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/40.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/41.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/42.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/43.png")} alt="" />

This is the confrontation in full. I grew very angry and tired of the things she was saying.

She was using gameguy for other things beforehand, those things I barely knew anything about until now. Even after this conversation, she did not use the opportunity the GC gave her to apologise to gameguy. She did not talk in that GC whatsoever.

### Statement regarding the use of the word "pedophile"

People have criticised my use of the word "pedophile" to describe her in this confrontation due to her age being 17, so I will make a statement about it.

For context, here are the times I have used this wording to describe her.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/44.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/45.png")} alt="" />

This was my personal opinion of her at the time. I knew that a 17 year old is not as developed as a 13 year old, and that a 17 year old is almost a grown adult, compared to a 13 year old, who is someone who has just become a teenager and has not reached puberty, so I was disappointed and angry. I saw her as a pedophile because of this.

As a 17 year old, she should have known better. Of course, legally, she is in fact not a pedophile due to her age, but that does not excuse her behaviour whatsoever. She is still a groomer, regardless of how you look at it.

Whether you wish to believe she is a pedophile or not is up to whether or not you wish to take into account the legal implication of pedophile, or the dictionary definition of pedophile.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/46.png")} alt="" />
The dictionary definition.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/47.png")} alt="" />
The definition on law.com. (https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1486)

<ins>End of statement.</ins>

## 608's behavior regarding the evidence

There are many cases of which 608 is outright lying to people in order to convince them that she is not a groomer. She hides evidence, puts evidence out of context, etc.

What people think of her actions is up to them. Showing them the full evidence is required to get their true opinion on the matter, and to properly defend yourself.

She knows what she's doing.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/48.png")} alt="" />

None of your points deny the fact you dated gameguy while 17 and knowing his age for a whole month. I do listen to your arguments, as seen throughout this document, however none of what you said disproves that key fact. Staying silent on this is not an option, as you have demonstrated that you are good at manipulating those around you. If this was kept silent/private, you would simply get away with it.

I understand that there is the possibility that you are not a pedophile (Update: Check "Evidence against 608's Counter Argument" for more information), but there is no doubt in my mind that you are a groomer, as you manipulated gameguy.

Another activity that 608 seems to do is manipulating people into thinking I want her doxxed. This is one of the reasons I'm making this document in the first place. In order to set things straight, and to avoid the deliberate confusion that she is giving to everyone. I was hoping leaving it to Marble's response would do, but I now realize I need to compile all of the evidence in order to explain things more efficiently.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/49.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/50.png")} alt="" />
Full image that wafkee got sent.

She told this to wafkee. I do not hate 608, I am only disappointed. I am disgusted in her actions. As you saw in the confrontation DMs, I do not wish for her to get doxxed. I said the opposite of that, and 608 took it out of context on purpose.

This image is two out of context images spliced together, by the way.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/51.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/52.png")} alt="" />
Full images.

## Accidental False Evidence

There is a piece of false evidence which got out of hand from people who I showed the evidence to, which is another reason why I wanted to make this document.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/53.png")} alt="" />

As you can see, this was a joke post. Sadly, it was accidentally sent once in public by Marble, but it was immediately deleted after I told Marble it was false information.

I don't believe anyone saw it other than 608, and I don't believe anyone saved it either. All you need to know is that if you see that screenshot, it's out of context.

## What 608 made Gameguy do

<GameguyStatement />

## Evidence against 608's counter argument

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/59.png")} alt="" />

This was after she knew his age. She could have declined, but she consented to it. If she truly was disinterested in gameguy after he told her his age, she would have declined.

I disagree with what Official B requested their permission to do, but as he is 15 I cannot call it pedophilia. Official B did not know his age at the time.

## 608's official removal from OTGC

608 has recently been removed from OTGC. It happened on 14 October 2022. Here is the conversation that happened on that day.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/60.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/61.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/62.png")} alt="" />

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/83.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/84.png")} alt="" />

In this conversation, I confronted 608, with everyone else as well. At the end, she was kicked, as you can see.

She contradicted herself in this conversation.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/85.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/86.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/87.png")} alt="" />

She said in her document that she could "barely maintain good grades" because all she can do is worry about this. However, she clearly seems to contradict this by saying she does in fact focus on school and has at least a 70 in each class right now.

I don't think that's barely maintaining good grades, 608. You have at least a 70 in each of your classes, and you focus on school according to yourself. If you were barely maintaining good grades, you'd be at the 60 mark, and if all you could think about was this, you would not be able to focus on school.

Which answer is it, 608? I don't get it.

## Sexual Activity with gameguy

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/88.png")} alt="" />

gameguy (13) (MIOFAN in the photo) since edited his messages, but as you can see, 608 (17) (Nepgear in the photo) is seen messaging gameguy "Would we all be in the same bed".

I won't say what was originally said before gameguy edited the messages, since he wanted it to be private, but it was something sexual.

<div style="font-size:1.2rem">
	Context

    <div style="text-align:center">
    	*You may notice the top part of the above image:*
    </div>

    <ins>"It said you can't physically do the stuff"</ins>
    <ins>"It didn't say you can't flirt"</ins>

    <ins>***There's a reason she said this. That reason is below.***</ins>

</div>

Below is an excerpt from OTGC. It was happening at the same time as the above image.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/89.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/90.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/91.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/92.png")} alt="" />

gameguy edited these messages from sexual messages to normal messages in the above image due to his embarrassment about what he said. The point is what 608 said, so please focus on that. People's reactions to what he said should give you an indicator of what he said anyway.

Another thing that proves that gameguy said something other than the edited messages was the fact gameguy did not go to sleep at this time. Some people stay awake on Discord, yes, but 608 would say something like "good night" instead of "Why did I laugh at this part" if he really said that.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/93.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/94.png")} alt="" />

**Highlight below.**

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/95.png")} alt="" />
In between the messages directly above this piece of text, they moved from OTGC to
"notsafefortopicgc" (OTGC NSFW GC) to talk.

<div style="font-size:1.2rem">
    <div style="text-align:center">
    	<ins>**With this context, we can understand clearly what she meant by the below quote from before.**</ins>
    </div>

    <ins>"It said you can't physically do the stuff"</ins>
    <ins>"It didn't say you can't flirt"</ins>
    (Message ID: [https://discord.com<wbr />/channels<wbr />/@me<wbr />/1010259682457301023<wbr />/1020842498400194621](https://discord.com/channels/@me/1010259682457301023/1020842498400194621))

</div>

She meant that in the Wikipedia article Temporalist sent, it didn't say anything about not being able to flirt with gameguy, and due to it all being related to only physical stuff, she was fine.

However, this isn't true. Flirting sexually with a 13 year old as a 17 year old is illegal. According to various sources, 608 lives in South Carolina, and in that state's law, it is clearly emphasised that 13 year olds cannot be sexual with 17 year olds.

The reason is because the age of consent is 16, and Romeo and Juliet laws go to at least 14 in South Carolina.

Due to gameguy being 13 at the time, that means that when 608 turned 17, she was illegally dating him.

**Sources for South Carolina law that I took from:**
https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/south-carolina-statutory-rape-laws.htm

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/96.png")} alt="" />
https://gbslawfirm.com/does-sc-have-a-romeo-law
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/97.png")} alt="" />

This means that 608's dating of gameguy, for at least one month, was illegal in her state.

## Other sexual comments around minors

As I'm writing this, Carly is about to be eighteen on 16 September 2022. EIGHTEEN. And she's still a pedophile.

Recently I was told that she was in a group chat, with people 13-14, and with a nine year old in there. She was talking about how horny she was, and wanted to buy dildos online. Remember, she is OLDER than these guys. So if she were to do this while she's 18, it's even MORE a problem. But now that I know about this, she's probably gonna try to stop doing that.

Below in these screenshots, she talks about how she wants c*m blasted in her *ss, and then she says it isn't a joke in the second screenshot. These are all red because she deleted the message right after but someone in the GC has message loggers.

After she found out I knew about the messages, she proceeded to prune all of her messages from there. Nice move, Carly. You're too late. **After this, she tried to say everyone in the group that were adults, which isn't true.**

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/98.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/99.png")} alt="" />
Here are the rest of the screenshots.
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/100.png")} alt="" />

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/102.png")} alt="" />

# Chapter 3: Child Manipulation

I have officially lost the screenshots of Carly's **twelve year old friend** due to Carly manipulating her into spying on a group chat. Remember that she manipulated a CHILD, so I'm just gonna send a few screenshots.

## Her IRL friend

**This is a short chapter, mainly because most information on this one has been moved to Chapter 5.**

I will be calling her IRL friend "y", and her sister "x", because I do not want their names involved, and they do not want their names involved.

Carly first of all made a huge mistake, inviting her OTGC friends to Y's server which is just a fan server of one of Carly's shitty auto tuned songs. She has given me alot of backstory on Carly's life outside of the internet, and her family, but I was told to not share it.

If you're in the GBC, you may remember a statement where Carly admits that she abused her grandparents. She did not do this according to y. According to Y, Carly yells at her nana frequently, which isn't verbal abuse, it's just disrespectful to elders. But from what I've heard, I think she has a pretty good reason for doing this.

**As of 12 July 2022, Y's Father has pulled her away from Carly, mainly because she's 12, and Carly is 17. That's kinda off, don't ya think? Her dad only allows her near Carly if someone is with Y, because of the whole grooming stuff.** You should not manipulate children bozohead.

Below is a screenshot admitting to worldcash that she manipulated Y.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/103.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/104.png")} alt="" />
Carly confesses that she manipulated her 12 year old friend to send screenshots
to her. I was trying to get her school info and her grandparents information for
a reason. She manipulates and grooms children for her own fun, and tries getting
away with it.

### The Aftermath

After three days of attempting to get in touch of Carly's school and parents, she revealed to worldcash that she manipulated y into sending screenshots to her. Y even said it herself and said Carly maker her spy on people against her.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/105.png")} alt="" />
So this is obvious evidence that Carly manipulated someone who's twelve years old,
which is 100% bad. She has also gotten her sister, who's also twelve involved with
some dramas.

# Chapter 4: Malicious Attacks

## 608's attempted server attack

If you read the "608's Removal from OTGC" part, you may have noticed the first 2 images showing something very interesting.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/106.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/107.png")} alt="" />

ActuallyTheMarioForever fan is 608.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/108.png")} alt="" />

gameguy banned her from his server, so she posted that announcement to tell people to raid it. It happened on 14 October 2022.

608 says she deleted the announcement, but that does not excuse her behavior. She clearly shows no signs of remorse here.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/109.png")} alt="" />

> <ins>**Gameguy note:**</ins> I banned her because I didn't feel I could trust her
> anymore.

Do you think someone not sending your counter argument is worth raiding their server for? You could have simply asked gameguy to post your counter argument, but instead you decided to tell people to raid his server.

Good job, 608. You made something into a bigger issue than it had to be again.

## Troop Attacks

<span style="color:magenta">
	*Screenshots with a purple background are provided by GBA
</span>
Carly has been planning to take down OTGC, with a group of people and somehow "Tadah
members", the Roblox revival game willing to help them out, and threatens us with
being doxxed, taking down OTGC, and ruining our reputations on the internet.

> "Yeah Carly, this will surely solve your problems" &ndash; Temporalist

This also includes some illegal stuff like DDoSing.

> "If you're going to threaten law enforcement, be my guest" &ndash; Croissant

That's not all. I'm going to go over the troops in this section.

## The Bullying

Carly has been recently bullying me (GBA) and OTGC members alot, with calling us nazis, calling me a kid and saying that I do drugs.

Here's all of the screenshots with Carly and others bullying

<div class="thin">
	<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/124.jpg")} alt="" />

	Luckily, the OSC wins. When people saw that Carly and her troops were voting
	yes, people were trying to mass reply to the poll with no.
</span>

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/131.png")} alt="" />

## Attempted Doxxing

Carly and her troops attempted to reverse search my phone number illegally, after I called Carly's grandmother. Her grandmother didn't seem to care about Carly grooming a 13 year old, according to Y and X, and either Carly or her grandmother blocked my Google Voice number.

Let's not forget that I used a Google Voice number to call her grandmother. Carly, if you're reading this, if you or your troops EVER attempt to find my school AGAIN, I will be actually calling the police on **you**, and maybe everyone else in your shitty group.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/132.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/133.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/134.png")} alt="" />

**^ This isn't true. I'm not in OTGC but I just know it's a crappy lie.**

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/135.png")} alt="" />

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/141.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/142.jpg")} alt="" />

### Attempted DDoSing

Also, she tried to claim it was false stating "now why would 4fr give me a bat".

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/143.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/144.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/145.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/146.png")} alt="" />

## "JKORA" Malicious Attacks

ALSO, she has made a doxxing group dedicated to harassing her "haters". This happened on June 15 2023.

<div class="thin">
	<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/147.jpg")} alt="" />
	<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/148.jpg")} alt="" />

	<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/151.jpg")} alt="" />
	<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/152.jpg")} alt="" />
	<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/153.jpg")} alt="" />
</div>

However, there was later a "deal" made and she deleted the server and renamed her alt account to "abandoned due to deal".

## Creepily Spying

Carly won't leave me (Marble) alone, and always manipulates people into spying on me. Here are a few examples.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/154.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/155.png")} alt="" />

Your Twitter is currently under surveillance, to make sure nothing stupid happens.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/156.jpg")} alt="" />

## Email Spamming

Carly and sadsad are constantly spamming my emails with either random newsletters, porn newsletters, registering me on sites with my email, etc. No, I am not registering for random sites. They also put the blame on Tale3339 and speakerpro2 for this, even though, Tale actually spams gore in peoples emails manually, and speaker is too braindead to do something like this. (WARNING: CROPPED NSFW)

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/157.png")} alt="" />

## Revolution Hill Lockdown

Nexo finally acknowledged that Carly is a manipulative person, and he locked Carly out of the OffTopicGC Control Panel. Luckily enough, I (Marble) still own the revhill.com domains, meaning I can manage the nameservers and other stuff.

During that, here are some leftover screenshots along with that

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/158.jpg")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/159.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/160.png")} alt="" />

### Statement from Nexo

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/161.jpg")} alt="" />

Carly, you do not own **any** rights to OffTopicGC. You have been removed from the group, so face it. You are a manipulative person, and you groomed gameguy. You're fucking disgusting.

## "Gaming Republic" Gate

Some of you guys may know that "Gaming Republic" is a disguised server to harass specifically Marble. She's been doing this since she got doxxed, and has been actively using this server to stalk and harass Marble.

The server was nuked on 16 March 2023, along with some other servers Carly owned.

Here's the screenshots below.

<div class="thin">
	<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/162.jpg")} alt="" />

</div>

# Chapter 5: Attempting to lie & getting away with actions

Carly has been trying to protect her reputation by giving her friends a bunch of lies. This is why the drama is still going, because she won't leave me alone and won't stop trying to attack OffTopicGC.

She basically tried to hypnotize Victor (a former friend of hers) into believing that she didn't groom anyone, and Victor hated her for that. He knew she did something wrong.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/180.png")} alt="" />
That's it? Told only him? No. Someone on Twitter (who I will not tell obviously)
sent me a screenshot of Carly telling everyone in one of her shitty Gummibar servers
that she didn't groom anyone.
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/181.png")} alt="" />
(kinda ironic because catzlol was probably gonna rat on us)

## Croissant's attempt to protect Carly

How ironic, because Croissant literally made 3 videos on Carly a year ago, and as soon as the fucker got doxxed everyone in the GBC be like ME AND THE BESTIE!!

Anyways, let's cut the jokes. Croissant decided to squeeze into the drama while I was having a little mental breakdown on my Twitter account, which was me showing my news of any information I've gotten from Y.

Squeezing into drama will also damage your mental health, as you also said it yourself in Gummisquad.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/182.png")} alt="" />

Here's the entire Twitter argument below.<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/183.png")} alt="" />
(he couldn't tweet this because of the twitter character limit, so he posted it as
an image)<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/184.png")} alt="" /><Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/185.png")} alt="" /><Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/186.png")} alt="" /><Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/187.png")} alt="" />
So, let's talk about the "crimes i comitted".

-   Oh WOOW! Carly totally wasn't doing that to literally alot of other people!
-   Yeah but I was doing it legally (because she groomed a 13 year old and manipulated a 12 year old)
    I was going to contact her school because her grandparents "didn't believe her", so I was trying to get in touch with both the police and her school.
-   Why would I spend money just to deliver a package to her?
-   Uh yea, that wasn't my idea. GBA said in the group chat to try to QR code into her Discord account, while Temporalist was just making (obvious) jokes of putting a usb stick into Carly's PC to rat it.
-   Yea sure, you know why.
-   ü§¶ she doxxed herself in otgc (the info on that one website are slaughterhouse addresses)

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/188.png")} alt="" />
Gameguy ended the argument by asking Croissant if he could talk to him, and worldcash
told me to not respond to Croissant, because there's no point.

<span style="color:red">
	Croissant is **still** trying to take me down with useless points
</span>

### Carly constantly sending screenshots to Croissant / Gamour / Bekzii

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/189.png")} alt="" />

## 4fr info

4fr (carly troop) threatened to make a document about me "threatening" to call the cops on Carly, when I was doing it for a justifiable reason.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/190.png")} alt="" />

Then after I tell him that Carly groomed gameguy, and manipulated y (a 12 year old), she quote tweets saying that I'm being lied to, even though there's enough evidence of the grooming and manipulation.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/191.png")} alt="" />
(The blue torch guy is worldcash and the "guy that humps body pillows" is officialb)

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/192.png")} alt="" />

4fr is also uhh... quite an edgelord

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/193.png")} alt="" />

## More examples of her lying

Carly has constantly told people that she is innocent, when she isn't.

# Chapter 6: "Expose" Attempts

## Raveway Gate

Carly has attempted to expose people a few times. She has a channel in Raveway/NewNewYork dedicated to "exposing" me. I'm gonna go over the Very Harsh Screenshots that she exposed me with.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/207.png")} alt="" />
First of all, the message where I said the t slur was obviously taken out of context.
Look at Chapter 4. Actually, I'll just send the screenshot again.
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/208.png")} alt="" />I edited
the message because obviously they were going to take the message out of
context. I'm not transphobic, and I support trans people. I said "did you know
Carly is also a "tranny"" because whoever owns this account kept using the t
slur on their little alt account.

Yeah, expose me all you want dumbass. It won't work, especially since you literally **impersonated** me on Hummus, spamming my DMs with gore. <strong style="color:red">(WARNING: CENSORED GORE)</strong>

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/209.png")} alt="" />

## RevHill Gate

I don't even need to explain this.

# Chapter 7: Gatekeeping & Gaslighting

## NounBlox Gate

Carly, gatekeeping your Discord to keep my alts and my spies out of the server won't really do much, since you won't know who's spying. I already got the screenshots of your huge obsession with me.

"Which won't happen" this ratio is what's happening

## Gaslighting

It comes to my realize that Carly managed to gaslight alot of people, including Victor, into supporting her again. When I realized this I proceeded to tip an FBI report on Carly.

Carly has gotten away with THIS document, except she gaslighted alot of people from the ORC. (I mean, it's the ORC, what can you expect?)

This screenshot is from before the second chapter was created.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/219.jpg")} alt="" />

And for the rest, you me ask?

First of all, she gaslighted Victor (who's now on the troop list for sending the fbi message to her), and after that I felt like filing a cybertip report aswell.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/220.jpg")} alt="" />

And she also announced her secret ingredient to a tweet I made

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/221.jpg")} alt="" />

## Suicide Baiting

Usually in situations like how someone recently got her Discord account disabled, she would pretend to be depressed to make people feel bad for her. If she vents anywhere, ignore her. She does this to try to get positive attention.

As of 15 May 2023, all of her main troops excluding sadsad1337 and Casenn has departed from Carly.

# Chapter 9: Response(s) to Carly's response

## Response 1

[The Carly Response (Mostly About The Gameguy Situation Currently)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vXWWWznYNI51IqsUk34xyA59bPcW0tlx3UZzKxHAx3Y) [(available on this site)](/the-carly-response)

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/230.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/231.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/232.png")} alt="" />

I knew about this beforehand, but the fact still remains that you manipulated Marble into thinking you still loved him, and convinced gameguy to take the blame for actions you made yourself. You should have dropped the relationship there and then, but instead you made it into a bigger issue than it had to be.

Marble's constant attempts to gain control of OTGC are something I cannot defend, but I cannot defend your manipulation of Marble either.

What you did is wrong, and you cannot justify it by saying that Marble did bad things too. Everybody already knows what Marble did, so it's time for people to know what you did.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/233.png")} alt="" />I have
nothing to say here, other than the fact that what he said wasn't "weird", it
was a genuine question.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/234.png")} alt="" />
You did agree to a sexual thing with gameguy, and while knowing his age. Check "Evidence
against 608's Counter Argument" for more information.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/235.png")} alt="" />I did not
add it because I did not think it was a necessary addition. You did not
manipulate Yakova/scarf from my knowledge, it was gameguy that wished for her to
be in the relationship.

<ins>Update, here is a statement from Yakova/scarf regarding this:</ins>

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/236.png")} alt="" />

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/237.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/238.png")} alt="" />

I never said you seek out people who you have a large age gap with. There is no evidence to suggest that to my knowledge. As for the no affection anymore thing, read "Evidence against 608's Counter Argument".

Also, nothing excuses the fact you did this in the first place. You didn't want to hurt Marble's feelings or make it worse, so you manipulated him into believing that you still loved him, leading to it hurting his feelings and making it worse once he figured it out.

Marble does not wish to hear an apology from you, so I will not ask you to give one, as you have already attempted to do so. He does not have to accept any of your apologies, as you have wronged him.

As for gameguy, you also manipulated him. You never told him to stop when he was taking the blame for your actions. You were too scared to confront Marble, so you let gameguy take the blame for what you said.

After gameguy admitted he was 13, you knew he was 13, and while you say you did not like him after that, you seem to have contradicted that statement in the "Evidence against 608's Counter Argument" evidence that I showed. You manipulated gameguy into staying in the relationship, although your goals of "scared of being kicked from the GC" cannot be trusted in my eyes due to the new evidence.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/239.png")} alt="" />

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/240.png")} alt="" />

I never denied your age, 608. You were in fact 16 when you first started that relationship. It does not change the fact that you continued it for almost a month when you turned 17.

This proves to me that you did not read my document properly, despite claiming to. If you're going to respond to my document, read it first.

Her response in OTGC.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/241.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/242.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/243.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/244.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/245.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/246.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/247.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/248.png")} alt="" />

As you can see, she claimed to have read it.

She did apologise to gameguy within his DMs. That does not excuse your behaviour all of a sudden though, 608. You clearly just wish for people to "forgive and forget". The world does not work like that, 608. Your actions have consequences.

As for what 608 said before that I remember her saying to me directly, I do in fact remember 608 saying that "not illegal" argument in the same GC she said the "How am I 17" argument. According to a witness, it is all deleted now. I have since been kicked from that GC. (OffTopicGC 7 was the name of that GC.)

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/249.png")} alt="" />
Witness account. Name removed for privacy reasons.

I also remember Croissant saying that argument as well, which I will respond to.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/250.png")} alt="" />

This is a very low quality image, but it displays the Gummibar community discussing after 608 told them about it.

Neither I nor Marble am not trying to push her to suicide. Marble simply made a video exposing her, and also a document. All I have done is expose the truth in my own document, as I felt it was necessary once 608 started lying to everyone about this situation.

As for the "that is not considered pedo behaviour" and "shes not 18" arguments, it is a 3.5 year age gap. 13 year olds are not as developed as 17 year olds. 608 knew what she was doing as soon as gameguy admitted his age to be 13.

As she is 17, legally, yes, she cannot be considered a pedophile, but regardless of that, it is abundantly clear that she intended to groom gameguy into staying into the relationship with her. gameguy was not as mentally developed as 608 during the relationship. A 17 year old is almost a fully grown adult, while a 13 year old is still a young child. This does not make anything she did right.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/251.png")} alt="" />

gameguy, Marble, and I attempted to confront you in a GC, but you went straight into my DMs. I've already confronted you about it within those DMs, and your answers were not satisfactory. What I am doing is exposing the truth that you are so desperate to hide. I was angry at what you said, because I knew what you did was wrong. I was willing to listen to you, but as the conversation went on I grew more and more angry by your responses.

Originally, I was not planning on making this document. I was planning on just allowing Marble to create his video. After all, creating a video on 608's wrongdoings is not wrong. If he wishes to do so, he can. His response video was quite accurate from what I've seen of it. It didn't have the full explanation in it though, as Marble only knew so much.

When I saw your response to what I said to you when I confronted you, and how you twisted the truth in order to fit your own goals, I knew immediately that my suspicions after confronting you were correct. You are a manipulator.

Talking about it together won't solve anything. You'll just find some way to sidestep the issue, and you won't learn anything from the experience. I even posted my document to OTGC before anywhere else so we could all talk about it, but your responses were not convincing whatsoever.

It's been clear from your responses to my document that you have no intention of allowing the truth to be seen, so I will do so myself, so you may learn that your actions have consequences.

All I am doing is compiling the truth to the best of my knowledge, the rest is on you.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/252.png")} alt="" />

{/* escapes bruh */}
{"608."}

You want it to go back the way it was? Where you manipulated others for your own gain? My answer to that is that you should forget about us, and focus on school. That is what I want you to do. Focus on your real life. You have an unhealthy obsession with OTGC that is unhealthy for everyone around you.

You want the drama to end? Think about how you can stop yourself from starting it. No one is obliged to forgive you, and your actions thus far have not shown any signs of remorse. You have caused more harm than good.

Your response has not shown me any other answer other than that you are a bad person. I want you to fix that, but I won't be helping you, all I will do is help you to realise that. No one in OTGC will be forced to help you either. You have to do it on your own.

I want you to leave OTGC alone of your own volition, and think about your life from there.

That is the end of my response to 608's response. Thank you for reading.

## Response 2

Carly has recently (as of 16 May 2023) responded to the allegations made towards her. The focus is heavily on me. There is some things I need to correct her for.

Before I get to that, I would like to point out that she's using her crappy friends to help her write _her_ response, and still isn't taking accountability.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/253.jpg")} alt="" />
_Yes, this is true, but he revealed his actual age to you like a moment after I was
removed from the group chat._
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/254.jpg")} alt="" />

    -   *Did this because you were attacking me over domains.*
    -   *Jesus christ you're still on this. YOU are the one brainwashing people, not even taking accountability.*
    -   *Because you're a groomer, abuser, and tried doxxing me?*
    -   *Whoops. Probably because you and Recon were trying to dox me, so I got you first.*
    -   *So I can report them for doing anything incriminating towards me. You also do the same.*
    -   *That comment I made on Croissant's video was clearly a joke, and he immediately got pissed at me for it.*
    -   *You do the same.*
    -   *I'm not breaking the deals, YOU are. I clearly try moving on from you but every month you do shitty things like trying to dox me & upload episode 2 to archive.org*
    -   *I did do this in 2022, but this time a few people got the ideas, so I just participated. Yea I got no excuse for this part, you're a danger to people.*
    -   *That wasn't me*
    	-   *Someone did report you, I know who it was, but I will not say who it was because I know you. You're gonna attack them for doing it.*

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/255.jpg")} alt="" />
_This isn't true. If I dislike you I would just block you on social media. I've only
exposed people that constantly attacked me (excluding that one youtuber and a few
others in that community), you were attacking me so here we are._
<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/256.jpg")} alt="" />

-   _Yeah, I heavily regret that. Should've listened to people in the OSC Discord about not talking to her._
-   _Not true. She's been lying about that for a while now without visual proof._
-   _Not like the entire OSC was against her, I turned against her because she got me banned from the OSC Discord and kept telling people my personal stuff where it got to the point where the ORC eventually found out and kept attacking me & mocking me for it._
-   _Why even bring this up? It's not even an object show to begin with._
-   _I do remember this, but it was actually in October(?) 2020. Mezstra shared screenshots of me jokingly flirting with one of my friends with zero context whatsoever. She said she was 14, but another 11 year old told everyone their ages._
-   _When have I EVER done this._

# Chapter 10: Sexualizing a user

**Before reading this part, I ask for you to [read the document made on Cole](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Xjols6bE59qgorr3XMB7Z6lAXW36y7Do1QCpe9aCg0) as well. It's also a groomer.**

## Context

Carly didn't groom anyone on this part (Cole is the same age as Carly), but just recently as I am writing this, someone sent her a face of Marble's recently ex partner (Cole) to her, and she immediately started sexualizing it's face, making a lot of dirty jokes about it with zero consent whatsoever.

Carly would then make Cole a mascot of NiceYomi's GoodBlox revival, and would continue on sexualizing Cole.

<strong style="color:red">
	Carly is lying about the mascot being a "noob". It is not a noob. She
	started lying about that when I added screenshots into the document, and
	would then continue on making sexual comments at Cole.
</strong>
I asked sadsad to ask Carly to stop making sexual comments at Cole (I hate both Cole
and Carly alot) and this was the result:

FYI: This is NOT her revival, it's also not the official GoodBlox. It's owned by NiceYomi.

<Image src={import("../images/the-608-documentary/269.png")} alt="" />

## Cole's response

I contacted someone that had (very much) contact with it, and it's response was very disgusted. It posted tweets on Twitter, making disgusted reactions. Carly would essentially delete the tweets that were quote retweeted by Cole. Here are the tweets:

# Conclusion

<ins style="font-size:1.2rem">**MARBLE'S CONCLUSION**</ins>  
<div style="padding-left: 1rem"> 
	Carly would do anything to get her friends back. She's a huge liar and got away with many of her actions. Everytime she apologizes, she will continue doing the same actions she's done for the past year, and doesn't plan on stopping.

    Everytime I update this document, she sends her troops after me to mentally harass me, and it just continues drama.

    DO NOT, AND I MEAN **DO NOT** attempt to protect Carly. She has damaged my mental health with this drama, and she has also mentally attacked me with her friends. Considering that this entire doc has literally 150+ pages sickens me. She has caused trouble to so many people on the internet. Do not trust Carly, and do not protect Carly. Any troops or goons are on the bottom of this document.

<div style="padding-left: 1rem">
	I believe there's still a chance for peace, both sides did wrong things. I tried to not be on the bad things. I don't think that Carly shouldn't have a chance for forgiveness, because everyone makes mistakes, and mistakes are the key to success, Tho still, if she attacks us one more time, I'm ready to call a lawyer.

<ins style="font-size:1.2rem">**VMWARE'S CONCLUSION**</ins>
<div style="padding-left: 1rem">
	Carly is annoying, continuously causes conflict with many people, and lied about screenshots in this document being faked. Do not trust Carly, she is a horrible person. She's always going to get her troops to spy or cause any conflict or work for her. Please ban her from any servers you administrate that she's in. If you decide to turn your back on her, she'll freak out on you and get you into conflict.

Carly will attempt to manipulate you in attacking people she doesn't like, and she'll try to get her troops to prove to herself that she isn't a bad person. Remember that she manipulated a twelve year old and groomed a thirteen year old.

Worldcash was not involved with this document. His part only shows his evidence in Carly's situation, so do not attack him or anyone that wrote this document please.
