# syntax did not do anything wrong

If you read the document that "exposed" syntax read this.

You don't have to had read the document though as I show images from it.

somethingelse accidentally messed up the new bootstrapper making people unable to play, so they had to update to fix error code 6  
Proof:

Also there is a reason to why they decided to change bootstrapper to Rust

People made alts for exploits that ruined the game so they added invite keys to prevent that, and while that sucks it had to be done because they literally were constantly breaking the game for everybody.

-   Revivals usually have a no alting rule
-   Baiting visits (aka farming visits) is literally not only gonna get your game onto the front page but also earn you Tix both of which you wouldn't have earned legitimately
-   You can't use cheats/exploits because they are mainly used in syntax for stuff like this
-   You can't tix tweak/farm because that's not a legitimate way to earn tix
-   What the f#ck is waxing

Some antiviruses flagged a wav file from syntax and wav is literally a audio file, so are you really gonna think virustotal is a 100% reliable source?

They perma banned the richest player because there was literal proof of them exploiting using alts.
