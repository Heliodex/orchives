So we all know of Carly’s pedophilic, manipulative, and narcissistic behavior. What if I told you that she’s apologizing in this document? We’ll be showing our group chat messages. If you question the validity of these messages, then you should ask Carly. Most of these screenshots were taken on **hummus.**

And yes, this is endorsed and recognized by her.

<Image src={import("../images/carly-owning-up/0.png")} alt="" />

**She’s actually acknowledging her actions.** Very shocking, actually.

## Part I &ndash; Censorship

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<kitproj>If you’ve been on one of Carly’s servers</kitproj><carly> (or any server I have had admin in)</carly><kitproj>, you probably know well that she likes to censor everything bad about her. Even small things. It even got to the point where this became a joke.</kitproj><dewd> (She set up an automod to censor things she didn’t like.)</dewd>  
<kitproj>
	I can’t think of what to write so here’s assorted screenshots of censorship.

## Part II &ndash; The Problematic Relationships

### JaredYoshi

<carly>
This was the first problematic relationship, although it is considered by everyone who knows about it as genuinely not my fault.  
Basically, I was around 15, and Jared was lying about being close to that age. On his 13th birthday, he revealed he was 13, and we never flirted again.  
There was no “official” breakup message but I’d say we just knew we were over.  
This one, unlike the others, could not be considered pedophilia, due to my age, and me no longer dating him once he revealed his age.  
I should have learned from this to find people’s age, and to not just trust the first thing they said, but no. Right after dating Marblyn, a similar situation would occur... Gameguy.

</carly>

### gameguy (and **Yakova/Porokimun**)

<carly>
This was what kickstarted the mass hatred of me in the ORC. Specifically the Gameguy part, as most probably didn’t bother to read the walls of text which explained how Yakova was also part of the relationship.  
This happened later on in it, as it originally \*was\* just Gameguy and I.  
There are some misconceptions about this but it did happen.

</carly>

#### Misconceptions

<carly>
One big misconception is that I had commissioned RR34 of Gameguy and I. The RR34 was made, but I merely “allowed” B to commission it. Still a horrible thing to do on my part.

Another misconception related to **NotSafeForTopicGC**. This was a group chat Gameguy made because Diced didn’t like seeing NSFW messages by him. It was said that I created this GC, and created it as a way to enable Gameguy and Yakova to be sexual. While the 2nd thing may have happened (albeit unintentionally?), I didn’t own **NSFTGC**.  
I likely also did some light flirting there as well, like in ((OTGC)).

The next misconception (although mostly just a confession?) relates to the doxxings of gameguy, Yakova, and... wafkee?  
Back during **late 2022**, when this drama was at its start, I had posted information I gathered about them to a private group.  
The gameguy dox just included first and last name, as well as 2 face pictures, and was only ever in one group chat, and one page of 4fr’s site World-Hill.  
The Yakova dox was just a first name, as well as middle and last initial, and phone number. I texted the number one time, with TextNow, and then never bothered again. This was only in a private group as well.  
The wafkee dox was just first and last name, and a half face picture. This was before he did an official face reveal (this year). In addition, this also was only ever in a private group, however he became (reasonably) scared because of it. To this day he seems scared of me, such as when he criticizes me he says stuff like “joking” shortly after.  
At a time, (right after the doxxes) he did block me and delete his original account. Eventually we re-met during the beginning of **NOUNBLOX**’s first era in 2023 (specifically March, I believe, is when we re-met). I consider him a friend and we seem to get along good, as well as me helping out with some of his projects.

</carly>

### Uyko/rec01n

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<carly>I’m sure, if you’re in the ORC, you’ve heard of this. In this section we will be confirming it, addressing parts that weren’t 100% true (really just one thing), and sharing more needed context.</carly> <dewd>If you somehow DON’T know, Carly has been in some questionable relationships…
with minors. As an adult. I know, it sounds bad. The minor in question being someone
named Uyko/Rec01n, not to be confused with recon. At the time, Uyko was 14 and Carly
was 18, which is obviously illegal. Carly sent some… Questionable messages to Uyko,
such as… Being horny and sending them feet pics! Of course they never ended up doing
that though. After a while, it ended and they became just friends.</dewd>

#### The whole story

<carly>
I was introduced to Uyko by Kit. He thought we would make good friends because she liked playing Novetus. I was added to a GC of Brick Hill users owned by her, which Kit was in, and we quickly became friends. This group chat contained Early, her previous ex (who at the time she was dating) which that situation was also like our relationship.  
Eventually, I started mentioning SANS (Social Avatar Network Script), and she said she knew a guy who made one. This is when Arby’s was made. The guy was Grizler. Over the months, we all became close. At first, she and Grizler were flirting occasionally, with Grizler even making RR34 videos including her character. I think my attraction to her began sometime after being really close with her for a while. It was before Grizler’s flirting I’m pretty sure, so mentally I wasn’t handling that well.  
Eventually, in Novetus, she said something as a joke. I believe it was “I love you”, which I responded saying I loved her too. We then just sat there in silence for a bit before playing it off. She jokingly complimented me some, but then stopped because I wasn’t also playing along.  
She then shortly after would reveal her thoughts about me, but it wasn’t official yet. Grizler was still there too.  
Eventually, she DMed me saying she loved me, and I said it back.  
At the time, I \*didn’t\* know her age. I think I learned it in the middle of the relationship. (Yes, not near the end). By then it was really hard for me to think of breaking up, because my past experiences with breaking up with people all went the same way:

1. Horrible
2. The people either leave me or harass me

Which are two things I don’t take well.  
Sadert was the first to realize the age gap, as Uyko was unknown to the ORC. He first talked to me about it on PrivateUploader/Flowinity, saying I should quit now before people found out.  
I didn’t quit and he eventually filled in all his friends on the context.  
A document was made by Worldcash and it spread like wildfire in the ORC, even more than the Gameguy ones.  
I tried to get out of this without any damage. At first, denying the relationship, then using broken math to say she’d be 16 now if she said she was 14 in some screenshot. Then outright \*saying\* she’s 16.  
Eventually I realized the relationship was a horrible thing and initiated the breakup.  
She took it well and we went back to being regular friends. She is currently with Kit and Wafkee now, which are closer to her age.  
While the “trying to get out” was occurring, I did several things, including admin abuse.  
Random pieces of phrases that related to it were blocked in automod in my servers. Eventually I even replaced my “screenshot Roblox so we know you’re 13+” verification with a “help let the ORC know Uyko is 16” verification. This “verification” became a joke among some people. It eventually was removed sometime after I broke up.

</carly>

---

## Part III &ndash; Getting Misconceptions out of the Way

<carly>
Throughout the drama there \*have\* been misconceptions. We will go over these in an organized manner.

</carly>

### Sending NSFW Images to Uyko

<carly>
This misconception began after two messages I sent to fin where I said I was doing such. I never ended up doing it. I \*did\* receive images a few time but it’s unconfirmed whether they actually were of her, and they thankfully weren't nude images.

</carly>

### Using ChatGPT in NOUNBLOX

<carly>
If you weren’t aware, NOUNBLOX was originally made as an improvement of Yomi’s old “KERNELBLOX”, based off of RBLXHUB and Nolanwhy’s source. What likely happened is that Yomi used ChatGPT in several areas.

</carly>

### The Leaked GC

<carly>
Originally made to be a crossover of people from different communities (and different parts of the same communities), it took a somewhat dark turn due to being leaked with an exaggerated backstory behind it.  
What is said is that me and my partners were talking sexually with a minor. I’m not sure whether there was a minor in the GC, as people added random people, but what I do know is that my partners and I did flirt a bit, but with each other.  
They also did send slightly weird messages. While you can’t deny the weird nature, I’m sure they were joking, such as the “I like pedos” or similar message.

</carly>

### Things I’ve Done with People’s Info

<carly>
I’m really responsible when it comes to storing data, so I always hash passwords.

However, there are 2 incidents where peoples’ passwords were exposed. Allow me to go over these.

</carly>

#### 1. Revolution Hill

<carly>
Revolution Hill suffered a password logging incident from Crapblox back in October 2022. Most people’s passwords who logged in were randomly generated, but a few people \*were\* effected.  
Here is the list (Excluding people who’s passwords seem to have been randomly given/reset ones):

<small>
**casenn05**  
**dylan**  
**Emage**  
**navinduaak**  
**catzlol**  
**Nate**  
**Administrator**  
**4fr**  
**Sex**  
**executive storage**  
**SwervoHasNoBitches**  
**GBA**  
**Saphric**  
**Merely**  
**truste**  
**N2B**  
**Cocaine**  
**bigbruhpizza**  
**Fanboys**
</small>
</carly>

#### 2. BLOX Construct

<carly>
Mine and Zy’s BLOX Construct was based on Avatarsquare, for testing. As a result, passwords were plaintext and we never got around to hashing them at the time. The site really wasn’t meant to be “public” yet.  
The site had several users, but not a lot. Some being in the ORC.  
Here is the list (Excluding alts aka duplicate accounts, and accounts that have seemed to use both a fake email and password):

<small>
**flameboy96**  
**4fr**  
**qa**  
**Emlee**  
**Czech**  
**AK17**  
**QQQ**  
**EpicXDavo**  
**Red**  
**calvinn000**  
**Lord**  
**Mcsafter**  
**dewd17787**  
**giaco5643**  
**Visualize**  
**Insanity**  
**34h**
</small>
</carly>

<carly>
If you, or someone you know was in either of these lists, make sure passwords are updated and secured.

This is something that will \*not\* happen again.

<small>
	<small>
		I don’t mean to plug but my latest BLOXCity site I made sure hashes
		passwords with a strong modern hash. This is something I do take
		seriously.
	</small>
</small>
</carly>

#### Info I may have of you

<carly>
If you use Z, the only personally identifying thing I have is an email. Everything else is either hashed, or not even stored connected to you.  
We do not link IPs to users, but hashed IPs are stored in the video views table, to prevent view botting.  
And relating to account deletion, I am considering adding something similar to Discord’s, where all the deleted accounts merge into one, and the account itself gets a name saying it’s deleted (That way it still exists so nothing breaks), and maybe also the option to delete your posts and stuff if you wish.  
It will be instant unlike Discord.

If you have used NOUNBLOX (any NOUNBLOX site, even not affiliated with me), the source did not hash IPs. That was something I was going to get around to. If you are worried regarding your IP, it is recommended to release and renew it, to get a new one.  
In addition, emails are not stored.

Revolution Hill stored the same things as NOUNBLOX.

The best thing my past sites (Other than that one with Zy) have stored is what NOUNBLOX and RevHill have stored.

I also have never ratted, nor attempted to RAT anyone, or give them malware. That’s something I don’t play around with.

</carly>

#### 3. Doxbin Leaks by Third Parties

<carly>
You may have heard of the PGing claims. The two ORC members I had successfully PGed in the past were due to information being available on Doxbin. That is the sole way I had obtained those accounts.

</carly>

### Suicide "baiting"

<carly>
I have, several times, expressed suicidal thoughts of mine, during times things were happening. Many considered this “baiting” due to the times they happened, but in reality it was just me cracking and opening up a bit due to not being able to take what happened.  
To sum it up, yes, the messages were real, and the thoughts were real too, and didn't just happen during those times but constantly.  
I have thankfully never physically harmed myself, as of now.

</carly>

### “Goons”/”Troops”

<carly>
Many people know of my small circles of friends, which oftentimes have spied on servers for me. They’ve earned the nickname “troops'' by some and “goons” by others.  
While I certainly do consider them friends, they never were solely “used” just for their ability to spy. However, I will admit, I shouldn’t have pressured them to do such.

</carly>

## Part IV &ndash; Acting Sexual Around Maxim

<carly>
Recently, a screenshot came out of my Z DMs.

<Image src={import("../images/carly-owning-up/4.png")} class="thin" alt="" />

I’m here to confirm I didn’t say these, and whoever had PGed me on the site was saying these.  
I wouldn’t have said such either way because:

1. I \*have\* a relationship already with 2 people and I’m not a cheater
2. I know Maxim is way younger than me

</carly>

## Part V &ndash; Annoyances

<carly>
This section is for addressing annoying things I do, which may not be 100% malicious or harmful, which leads us into one everyone who has ever stalked my Twitter has seen:

</carly>

### Schizoposting

<carly>
The first one that got to the ORC was me claiming I was going to sell the 2021 RCCService (in 2021 or early/mid 2022). Due to the drama not having started then, I was defended by Neek and others, who said I was joking when Brent quote retweeted talking about selling Roblox’s property.

Some famous ones are the ones that pertain to “Friends2013”. Like with quite a lot of things I say, I did think the “shadow government” thing was somewhat true when posting originally. Eventually, restating it just became an impulsive thing.  
This is the same with:

-   “Limbo being a rat”
-   “Limbo using ECS site source”
-   “Qzip stealing Crapblox”

and more.

Anyone in Arby’s could tell you about some other of these as well. Such as “the ORC planting fake Carlys in my school to make me go insane”, or, “the ORC having devices hidden around my house to surveillance me”.

I also did not realize this was schizoposting until I saw some random Tweet about some guy who was claiming they were one of the Undertale characters and that Toby secretly knew it, and I realized how similar it looks to most of my Tweets. So I have determined it’s a mix of schizophrenia and sleep deprivation. The two things that have ALWAYS added more fuel to this fire, and probably why it is at such a level it is today.

</carly>

### “Smooth” Advertising

<carly>
A thing I’ve been somewhat known for is my advertising of things I create or endorse. It’s not through normal means. Let me give some examples.

-   Defacing sites (Such as Quadium/the new squareBracket by Kylarz, and Mouchette.org) to advertise my stuff
-   Spamming Brick Hill games and forums, ban evading with several alts, even including Lukeposting
-   False statements to persuade people to come
-   Being overly competitive with sites that are remotely similar
-   Getting “competing”/similar sites taken down

</carly>

---

## Part VI &ndash; The Drama Before This

<carly>
Back in 2020, I was 100% sane. I had just got into the GBC and quickly rose to the tops with other known members. We had fun times, and even made and abandoned projects, just like OTGC, just like now (lol). I got into a relationship with Jade (whos username was Hajime then, but mostly known as Gamour).  
This all came crashing down January 1st, 2021 (I’m not even joking).  
What did I do? I was annoyed by Jade’s recent lack of talking to me seriously, so for some reason, I made a GC with me and the rest of the friend group, about canceling her.  
Eventually, I accidentally DMed her instead of the GC, leading to our fallout. I think this was the start of the rapid decrease in mental health I would go through.  
It then worsened after we all were going to dox and blackmail “Mary”, someone we labeled as a pedophile. While it’s possible she is or was, that’s still not a good thing for us to do, as she was only 17 then.  
The user now known as Bekzii, or Bea, called out this upon returning and seeing the GC, which I removed as an immediate reaction.  
I came back to Discord seeing the whole group blocked me and turned against me.  
It’s a lot like the situation in the Gameguy doc where I was begging to stay in OTGC. I even offered the same thing about staying there but not talking. Eventually, I was still removed.  
I did a lot of things in the GBC then, which, looking back, included a lot of schizoposting. It really was similar to this drama in a way, and included the doxxing of an innocent person, as well as “competing” with gummisquad with my “GummyClub” (Sound a lot like some of my revivals?), and stealing their advertisements and channel layouts, even spying on them.  
Eventually, an expose video was made on me by Croissant, which I was denying everything about. Then a 2nd. Then, Bekzii infiltrated Whirled and caught me spreading misinformation about the videos, which turned into a third.  
Neek will have seen these videos before we began talking much.  
I also began moving to the ORC during this drama. Starting with finally downloading GoodBlox, so I could use my account I made in 2020.  
This is where I met Temporalist, JGG, and others.  
I eventually would go on to add Gameguy, from the GBC. (Similar to _this_ drama, I had a small group of people on my side, I even called it “the good side”, there’s just so many similarities).  
GoodBlox closed, we joined Rhodum, found Wafkee, etc.  
Eventually we moved to a new GC created by Gameguy, dedicated to going “offtopic” so we didn’t have to discuss the actual topic of the GC I made, GoodBlox bloopers.  
OTGC originally was called “offtopic” and was just a friend group.  
I “turned it into” OffTopicGC after Gameguy once said “offtopicgc.com” as a joke, and Neek further made it into a “brand” after he was added and got settled in.  
We started making projects, and for the first time, they got many users. This started with Gravitar, which a member advertised on the Brick Hill forums days after release.  
Our most known was Revolution Hill (RevHill), a Brick Hill clone/alternative where Lukeposting was endorsed. This was the root of hatred it received.  
As well as the association with Neek, which brought in hatred from the ORC. Neek and I shortly started dating around this time, and the whole ORC thought I was his alt. I consider this the start of their hatred for me.  
Eventually, drama was occurring every day, and Neek left and started attacking the GC. I realized he was being manipulative and cut him off, only letting OTGC know, instead of him. He was still DMing me and thinking we were together, which was my mistake. I didn’t want him to start attacking me due to me initiating a breakup. Around this time, Gameguy’s flirting he did to me grew even bigger (He did flirt with me when Neek was still there, with me not responding). I eventually cracked and gave in on a random day where he asked “Can you be my Gamegirl?”. At the time, the general consensus was that he was “17”. This is what he told everyone. So I didn’t start the relationship knowing he was much younger.  
Eventually, he revealed it to me, and then the other GC members. I said I’d still date him if he were 13, because I didn’t want to lose him as a friend. In past GCs I said it was because I was afraid of “what he’d do” to me, or similar, but really this was the reason. I didn’t want to lose _another_ friend group.  
The relationship continued without interference (Even eventually adding Yakova into the mix) for months. The first to ever say small things about it being odd was Temporalist/ga. Eventually, everything came crashing down when Gameguy revealed his age in a group chat that contained Neek. The first document was shortly made, and then Neek would proceed to plagiarize it. And that’s everything from the start of the GBC drama to the start of this drama.

## Part VII &ndash; Editors’ Experiences with Carly

### Sh0rk

<sh0rk>
[Trigger warning for my part, mentions of overdose and süicide.] Hi I’m Sh0rk, I didn’t really know of Carly before like August 2023 but as soon as August 2023 hit, I rejoined the ORC and was in Old Staff with all my friends and I saw the Carly doc when everyone talked about it. I can say that this is all true, she has manipulated people and groomed kids on the internet, but she is trying to fix this and hopefully her cutting us off can fix whatever problems she has caused. She has kept my Z account hostage recently after I left that website. I have seen that NOUNBLOX used ChatGPT code according to comments in the PHP files. I’m fine with using ChatGPT to help with little parts of your code, but when you use it for a lot, most, or the entire thing (Madblox..?) It's very problematic, ChatGPT can give you insecure code and it’s very obvious if you don’t give a shit after using the GPT code because its comments are obvious. I first noticed this ChatGPT in the Register page, seeing comments like “Add … for security”, obviously from ChatGPT (as someone who has used chatgpt for snippets, it leaves comments like this in those as well if you dictate it) As I am writing this there is a chat section in the google docs, so I will reference things Carly says. “I still am confused about those probably were in the original Kernelblox source” Carly admitted that Nounblox isn't fully her code, GJGJGJ. Us in Old Staff now own the NOUNBLOX revival as a whole and I sh0rk may take control over Z (Carly didn't confirm anything in this Z deal yet). Under a past alias Zevix (shortened to Zev), in Late August or Early September 2023, I was impersonated by Carly on Kapish when I was not ready to join any revivals of any sort. This caused me to nearly overdose on Tylenol because I was not even close to recovering from my mental issues and was still pretty süicidal. In late January or early February 2024, Carly had caused more drama which caused my boyfriend to go into a suicidal episode and he would have killed himself if he had enough resources. Luckily, he didn't. These are enough in my experiences to show that Carly’s actions were not good, and that she can improve A LOT. I won't be blocking Carly as I want to check up on her from time to time and see if she's getting better. I hope everyone can learn from this drama and improve themselves. As for my opinion on doxxing, pizza bombing, and swatting, I have witnessed these all and I don't think they should be done on anyone. It's wrong to leak private information on the Internet and it is also wrong to try and get someone killed. Carly is clearly like this because she has mental issues, she needs help. I can tell that she has some sort of mental issue as well because as I have mentioned I went through some myself before. If you have done these things to Carly or are planning to, please don't. She is trying to improve as a person and get help. It doesn't help her any when you send a team of powerful armed cops to someone's house because of internet shit. As of February 13th, 2024, I won’t be associating with Carly until she genuinely gets help with her mental issues and pedophilia. The only reason I will be messaging her is if there is an urgent situation or to check on her occasionally.

</sh0rk>

### Kit

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<kitproj>Hello, I’m Kit. I met Carly in February of 2022 and have mostly stayed friends with her. I met her and wafkee around the same time, but I met wafkee first. At the time, I was on a sandbox site called Mopaiv and I was getting bored of how the community would die so quickly. So I decided to go look at the YouTube channel belonging to Ninfo, a popular creator among sandboxes. There, I found Gravitar, a SANS wafkee created. Through this, Carly put an advertisement for Revolution Hill a few days after I joined. I made an account for Revolution Hill, and very quickly joined the staff team, as there was not too many users at the time. If Carly would’ve had better hiring standards, I wouldn’t be here. There’s been several occasions where she has made me defend her, because of the large dramas. For a very long time, I was considered her sidekick and only recently have I got away from that label. Within this time period, Carly has picked up and abandoned roughly 20 projects.</kitproj><carly> (That’s an issue I have. Most just don’t stick despite being good ideas. It’s also probably way more than 20.</carly><fin> I “abandoned” more.</fin><carly>)</carly>
