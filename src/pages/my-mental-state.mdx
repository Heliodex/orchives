Long story short: I'm quitting.

known for making many docs to tell people how is my life (horrible), and I've come to the blink of it.

I'M FUCKING DONE.

Discord and other social media has been STRESSING FOR OVER 3 FUCKING YEARS ALREADY, I'M SO FUCKING TIRED OF THIS.

I HAD TO DEAL WITH LOSING ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO GOT EXPOSED FOR SAYING THE N WORD  
AND I LOST ONE OTHER FOR IGNORING THEM ON ACCIDENT  
I LOST A FRIEND WHO GOT EXPOSED FOR SUICIDEBAITING (not metallic), THREATENING AND EVEN FUCKING MORE.  
I NEVER WANTED THIS ALL TO HAPPEN  
I'M SERIOUSLY AN FUCKING HORRIBLE PERSON  
THERE'S MORE BEHIND JUST LOSING FRIENDS BUT IT'S PERSONAL  
I just wanna quit Discord. I'm serious.  
drama never ends, it's infinite.  
especially when it comes to old drama (keeping an eye on you SonicAlex500), people have to bring it back for NO. FUCKING. REASON.  
I'M STRESSED OF THIS SHIT.  
I'm an horrible person in general.  
and I will never improve, unfortunately.  

I don't wanna live anymore.
