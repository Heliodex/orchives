Welcome to the ORC Document Archive. This is a collection of notable archived & re-transcribed documents relating to the Old Roblox Community.

The documents here are attempts to maintain the same formatting as the original documents, but fix any spelling errors, organise them, and make them easier to read. No information in them has been changed, and information is given with no guarantee of accuracy or validity.

None of the information in these documents should ever be taken as fact; this site only aims to archive existing documents. As such, information in these documents should not be used as evidence in any situation, or be used for the purposes of proof, harassment, or defamation.

## Information

Other miscellaneous information that doesn't fit anywhere else is listed below.

### Access

The ORC Document Archive is accessible at the following URLs:

-   https://orchives.heliodex.cf (primary)
-   https://orchive.heliodex.cf
-   https://oda.heliodex.cf

### Process

Most documents on the site were originally distributed on Google Docs. Images are extracted from the documents and ordered, then the document is re-transcribed in Markdown by hand. If the document has export options enabled, this speeds up the process. "Web Page (.html, zipped)" is the easiest export option to work with. Note that documents from Google Docs may contain Unicode smart quotes, which should be replaced with normal quote marks.

If the document contains formatting issues or spelling errors, these are manually fixed. Document layouts that do not fit well into basic Markdown formatting are written with embedded HTML and CSS, and fonts and other layouts are adjusted to be reasonably uniform across the site. Basic changes (eg. text colour and justification, image location) are kept where possible. Related content, such as linked or embedded audio or video, is downloaded and embedded in the document.

> Why not AsciiDoc?

I wish.

### Updates

When documents are found to have been changed, they are also updated on the site.

-   If information has been added to or changed in the document, the document is updated to reflect the new information.
-   If information is removed, the previous information is merged into the new document in a logical manner. A note may also be added in the **Additions** section at the end of the document. The original document should be used as a reference.
-   If the name of the document has changed, it is also updated on the site. Document URLs should remain permanent.
-   If the new name of the document does not reflect the original, the previous name is kept.
-   If the document has been removed entirely, it is kept on the site for archival purposes alongside a notice.
-   If the document has been replaced entirely with a short statement or update (as commonly happens), the previous document is kept and the notice is added to the document's **Additions** section.
-   If the entire document is moved to another location (most often with a short statement or update accompanying it), it is counted as the same document.

Semi-related information that may also be of interest will be added to the **Additions** section. If information is requested by popular demand to be appended to the document in the event of large-scale misuse or harassment, the information may also be added. <ins>Misinformation, disinformation, or defamation alone is not a reason for removal or modification of a document, and information in them is never to be taken as fact.</ins> See the top of this page for more information.

### Licence

The documents themselves have no licensing information attached to them. Information on the site is public domain.
