## BIO

Hey, I am <span class="fin">fin</span>. That one 20 year old guy at ORC. I made this document about newuser just to tell what he did, after <span class="yeano">yeano</span> and <span class="quantam">quantam</span> (not quato) started making a document about me. Honestly that document is just stupid. I don't know how they will **<ins>expose me so hard</ins>**, information is too old.

Hey, I am <span class="Shedletsky">Shedletsky</span>. The 17 year old guy from the ORC. I edited this document and helped <span class="fin">fin</span> with this document.

	Hi, I'm Carly. The 17 year old that people like to call a pedo just like
	they do to Fin because the ORC loves to lie. I met Fin when Rhodum 2 started
	and have been his friend ever since.

So let's start.

## CHAPTERS

### Chapter 1: Exiled Hacking <small>(w/ <span class="quantam">quantam</span>)</small> | written by <span class="fin">fin</span>

<strong class="quantam">quantam is ino</strong>, by the way.

One of the **laziest, stupidest, boring** hacks in the world. What I think happened was that <strong class="newuser">newuser</strong> gave my panel password to <strong class="quantam">quantam</strong>, which then downloaded the website source code and pasted ton of alerts. <span class="quantam">quantam</span>, on **Andrew/Fin: The Whole Shabang** admitted that they planned all of this. The alerts mentioned ino on alerts, so when I've seen it I told him if he participated in this event, and he said no. That was a lie.

---

When I found <strong class="newuser">newuser</strong>'s revival that barely worked named <strong class="TestService">TestService</strong>, I have immediately went in there to see if the source was leaked. It was there with some hate messages. I have forced him to remove the source not because it's just because it was my revival, **I executed a command that could collect the IP of the user who would take the SQL**, which collected both of their IPs.

### Chapter 2: Age Reveal + <span class="qzip">qzip</span> Hacking | written by <span class="fin">fin</span>

<small class="fin">
	Hey, it's been months! Well, I just found out that I didn't mention that the
	account was not an Exiled account, instead a Discord one. Well, off we go!
	**(20 October 2023)**
</small>

That was like an entire war, LOL. newuser admitted that he asked <span class="qzip">qzip</span> to hack the entire website, while <span class="newuser">newuser</span> was abusing admin permissions and giving roles to every person. **It all started from nothing.** Really! A person accidentally logged into my account (I was secured with 2FA) and changed the avatar to the one he supposedly wanted to do on his account, but changed it for me. Laughed a little bit, till <span class="newuser">newuser</span> took it seriously. And well, with these words the hack begun and lasted 2 days till I got the ownership.

---

**In the next day he says in the group if we can end this, which means he's a fucking pussy!** He said that because I would expose him, which I am doing right now. Okay, here's the interesting part, <span class="newuser">newuser</span> tells me the reason for the hack was because I was racist, well he was racist too. Don't say no. Literally at 1 January 2023 during night he said "**HAHA NIGGERS**", so that was a false point and they did this for nothing. Imagine spending $30 dollars and a server provider didn't even patch a vulnerability.

---

He then said he was 13 years old this year, which means he was underage all the time. If <span class="bgr2">bgr2</span> was banned for being 13 years old, then he will be banned too. Of course he will, he literally used Discord when he was **11**!

### Chapter 3: Child Sexual Abuse Material | written by <span class="fin">fin</span>

<div style="text-align:center">
	Size was 1.52GB, not 1.87GB. Teen age is 13-17.
</div>
It all started in a group named Basement. Exactly at 7 June 2023 11:52 PM, he sent
a link and I actually said "that's legal"! Yeah I didn't see what Teen age was..

Message from <span class="Carly">Carly</span>: **If you think this was fake you can ask anyone who was in the group (me, fin, guy1770, Casenn, mangloid, axd, LRC\_, GBA)**

<div class="thin" style="text-align:center;margin:0 auto">
	<Image src={import("../images/newuser/1.png")} alt="" />

    asking vmware if he knows it (27 June) before making the document

    <Image src={import("../images/newuser/2.png")} alt="" />

    <span class="newuser">newuser</span> trying to get rid of me LOOL idiot

    <Image src={import("../images/newuser/3.png")} alt="" />

    13-17 is not child sexual abuse material, you can watch it! 🤓

    <Image src={import("../images/newuser/4.png")} alt="" />

    He says that porn with underages is illegal, but with 13-17 is legal.

    <Image src={import("../images/newuser/5.png")} alt="" />

    4 violations, he was an underage. Broke TOS 5 times and says that I got banned 7 times and he never was, scumbag.

    <Image src={import("../images/newuser/6.png")} alt="" />

    Now he says that I sent child sexual abuse material too.

    <Image src={import("../images/newuser/7.jpg")} alt="" />

    UPDATE: **It's actually child sexual abuse material, oh god.**

### Chapter 4: Clients | written by <span class="fin">fin</span>

If some Exiled members remember the release date of 2015, you gotta hear this. <span class="newuser">newuser</span> did not patch clients, <span class="Invitat">Invitat</span> did. <span class="Invitat">Invitat</span> was an admin on Exiled until it shutdown, known as <span class="Invitat">AlainsXisaDuck</span> or <span class="Invitat">AXD/znxd</span>. He was patching clients under <span class="newuser">newuser</span>'s name and was a patcher for 2013 and 2016 clients when Exiled was on a rewrite. <span class="qzip">qzip</span> when nuked Exiled found the 2013 installer, sent it to my DMs. The client was originally supposed to be available, and was ready for use, yet we didn't give full instructions. The bootstrapper would work if the client was downloaded, but since people didn't have the client installed at first, the bootstrapper wouldn't work. It was kinda useless, anyway.

### Chapter 5: Reactions About <span class="newuser">newuser</span> | written by <span class="Shedletsky">Shedletsky</span>

I remember that <span class="newuser">newuser</span> was selling his account (<span class="fin">fin</span> told me this in a gc) after <span class="newuser">newuser</span> nuking the Exiled server,fin told something to us in the Folaroid server (an old revival that <span class="fin">fin</span> made, also <span class="fin">fin</span> gave us some information at the Folaroid server.)

### Chapter 5: Experiences About <span class="newuser">newuser</span> | written by <span class="Carly">Carly</span>

This all started when _Rhodum 2_ was a thing. Newuser would constantly threaten closure over the smallest form of criticism and would make polls on if the site should shut down (without talking to _**<ins>ANY</ins>**_ other owners first).  
Rhodum 2 constantly switched servers, and <span class="newuser">newuser</span> would buy boosts for every server. (He did this for another unrelated server of his and <span class="Snowy">Snowy</span> 's as well).  
One day, his account started changing to odd things. This was around the same time <span class="nolanwhy">nolanwhy</span> got ratted, which we thought had relation at the time. Here are some images from around the multiple times he faked getting hacked:

<Image src={import("../images/newuser/8.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/newuser/9.png")} alt="" />

<strong style="font-size:2rem">We are done.</strong> **<small>
	(as for now)
</small>**

<div style="font-size:1.2rem">
> To people who call <span class="fin">fin</span> or <span class="Carly">carly</span> pedophiles, just look up at Google, or just have this screenshot that we found. &ndash; Shedletsky
>
> <Image src={import("../images/newuser/10.png")} alt="" />

I (<span class="fin">fin</span>) am literally disgusted y'all have balls to call me a pedophile and not even dare to look up the definition.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<span class="newuser">newuser</span> did more damage than <span class="fin">fin</span>. And if you want proof, just take a look at this table I (<span class="fin">fin</span>, mostly edited by <span class="Carly">Carly</span>) made.

{/* jesus christ markdown table formatting is horrible without monospace or with line wrap */}
| <ins><span class="fin">fin</span> (20)</ins> | <ins><span class="newuser">newuser</span> (13)</ins> |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Sent child sexual abuse material without knowing (1 video which started off normal and he didn't see the rest iirc)<br />Also didn't defend it | Sent child sexual abuse material<br />Defended it |
| Nuked revivals (for good reasons) | Nuked revivals |
| | Abused admin permissions |
| | Used Discord under age of 13 |
| | Participated in hacks |

This chart is 100% true and there's no lies. The ORC just loves to see the downfall of innocent people, they are doing this to me (<span class="Carly">Carly</span>) too.

## Good

<strong class="fin">fin</strong>: reported loli channels at Telegram, helping
with code ← (basically what I rarely do)
<strong class="newuser">newuser</strong>: said helped axd with clients, not sure
'bout that innit {/* prettier-ignore */}
<small>_**<ins>(EDIT AS OF 20 OCTOBER 2023!!! he didn't.)</ins>**_</small>

I only listed 2 to myself, I don't even know what good <span class="newuser">newuser</span> did.
