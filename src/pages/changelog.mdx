# Changelog

## 30 September 2023

Added [The 608 Documentary](/the-608-documentary). This one took a while to transcribe, as it's well over 10,000 words long and contains close to 300 screenshots and images.

Some documents I'm considering transcribing next could be:

-   The other Google Docs links referenced in The 608 Documentary, some of which have export options disabled so might be more difficult to copy from.
-   That one about Dshoe10 if I can find the original, which I transcribed most of a long time ago (and will have to look for where I put it)

## 24 September 2023

Initial release. Includes four documents that I'd previously transcribed.

-   [Meteorite: The Whole Shabang](/meteorite)
-   [The Aftermath of the Aftermath: Meteorite](/meteorite-aftermath)
-   [A document against Sleep](/a-document-against-sleep)
-   [Tadah Staff Corruption and M3X](/tadah-staff-corruption-and-m3x)
