# Changelog

## 10 November 2023

Added [Jeno: The truth](/jeno).

## 8 November 2023

Added [Yomi's experience with "Carly"](/yomis-experience-with-carly).

## 27 October 2023

Added [The Incompetence of Economy Simulator.net](/incompetence-of-ecs).

## 22 October 2023

Added the [Aep doc](/aep). Unfortunately I don't know its full name since the original document seems to be no longer available, though please contact me if you have any more information about it.

Updated the [Samtheman expose doc](/samtheman) to add Samtheman's response video in the Additions section.

## 18 October 2023

Added [Evidence of 608/Carly (18) Dating a Minor (14)](/evidence-of-608-dating-a-minor).

A new page has been added to the site: [searches](/searches). The page will contain a list of documents I'm currently searching for, and outlines where anyone can provide information or help with finding them.

## 16 October 2023

Some links to [The 608 Documentary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzcGfltf9EgArbHkycW9vYx2CoGPonHrWa29d_RyIbc) on the site linked to a inaccessible copy of the document rather than the public version. This has been fixed, thank you to everyone that brought this to my attention by pressing "request access" about 50 times.

Added a few more documents.

-   [TheOfficialLetterE - The man behind idiocracy](/letter-e)
-   [Evidence Against 608/Carly](/evidence-against-608)
-   [Samtheman expose doc](/samtheman)

## 4 October 2023

All images on the site have been optimised, and will load much faster now. Having exactly 420 <sup>nice</sup> images on the site was causing high bandwidth consumption, so it should help that as well.

Added [Gameguy: The Whole Shabang](/gameguy).

## 2 October 2023

Added [Statement against 608 (Also known as Carly)](/statement-against-608). The document had a lot of its information copied into [The 608 Documentary](/the-608-documentary), so there may be some overlap, and many of the same images and screenshots are used.

## 1 October 2023

Added [The Carly Response (Mostly About The Gameguy Situation Currently)](/the-carly-response) as a follow-up document to [The 608 Documentary](/the-608-documentary).

## 30 September 2023

Added [The 608 Documentary](/the-608-documentary). This one took a while to transcribe, as it's well over 10,000 words long and contains close to 300 screenshots and images.

Some documents I'm considering transcribing next could be:

-   The other Google Docs links referenced in The 608 Documentary, some of which have export options disabled so might be more difficult to copy from.
-   That one about Dshoe10 if I can find the original, which I transcribed most of a long time ago (and will have to look for where I put it)

## 24 September 2023

Initial release. Includes four documents that I'd previously transcribed.

-   [Meteorite: The Whole Shabang](/meteorite)
-   [The Aftermath of the Aftermath: Meteorite](/meteorite-aftermath)
-   [A document against Sleep](/a-document-against-sleep)
-   [Tadah Staff Corruption and M3X](/tadah-staff-corruption-and-m3x)
