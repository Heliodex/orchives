    On 19 January 2024 he threatened my revival by calling it dogshit and saying that it wont last for long

</div>

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/1.png")} alt="" />

And the site wasn't finished yet

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/2.png")} alt="" />

(Note: around 18 January 2023, I was making a site for BEASTBLOX, but I was dumb at the time and didnt really know how to code so I used a bit of ChatGPT, but when I was making atomblox site, I copied the heart folder from the old beastblox site, and modified it, and there was a file named update_status.php or something that had the require(/path/to/db.php). So I forgot to remove the old code leftover from the previous site I was working on.)

He found a forum post from along time ago, and idk he tried to flex that he found my name?

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/4.png")} alt="" />

Here he said the n word

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/5.png")} alt="" />

Now ariez is threatening my revival with a DMCA, which is just stupid tbh

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/6.png")} alt="" />

(Note: don't go on the link, possibly an IP grabber)

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/7.png")} alt="" />

He said he was going to buy me a domain, which I highly doubted at the time, because he threatened to DMCA me.

Then on 20 January 2023, I opened gmail to check it, then I saw a email from Cloudflare with a DMCA.

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/8.png")} alt="" />

As you can see, ariez DMCA'd my site, but I knew it wasn't roblox because the email ended with @kittys.me

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/9.png")} alt="" />

And ariez also bragged about it in Blue16 (Where ariez is a dev)

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/10.png")} alt="" />

Ariez also said this in my DMs

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/11.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/12.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/13.png")} alt="" />

Also, newuser said about suggesting to DMCA them back, to which I replied no (in atomblox announcements)

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/14.png")} alt="" />

Ariez saw it and said this in my DMs (Note: talking about killin and lawyers)  
Scroll down if you wish to see what he said!

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/15.png")} alt="" />

As you see, he threatens that they will send a hitman to kill if he gets DMCAd and will sue me to infinity.

Now I will post images involving ariez and whatever.

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/16.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/17.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/18.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/19.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/20.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/21.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/22.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/23.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/24.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/25.png")} alt="" />

And ariez destroyed another revival named vaporz

And is targeting latrev

<Image src={import("../images/ariez-atomblox/26.png")} alt="" />

<div style="text-align:center">
	Now what will I do?  
    Well I'll probably make atomblox only for beta testers y'know.  
    And uhh don't use cattodomains or blue16.xyz.
