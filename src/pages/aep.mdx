Aep isn't the guy that you think.

Aep did:

-   Nuking Discord servers for no reason
-   Skidding void src (frontend\backend)
-   Being racist
-   Having an huge ass ego
-   Doxxing
-   Hacking innocent Discord account

Aep is also known as "deleteduserabhdsd122221" on Discord aka "EpicXDavo".

<Image src={import("../images/aep/1.png")} alt="" />

Aep did many bad things on this account such as nuking void Discord server for no fucking reason???:

<Image src={import("../images/aep/2.jpg")} alt="" />

He is also acting very immature to any void staff instead of "coding" on his own revival named "fossci"

<Image src={import("../images/aep/3.png")} alt="" />

Aep made his revival because wumbo helped a little EVEN if he was very BORED of him because he was asking every fucking single days about how to patch smth (aep admitted he doesn't know reverse engineering aka assembly)

<Image src={import("../images/aep/4.jpg")} alt="" class="inline" />
<Image src={import("../images/aep/5.jpg")} alt="" class="inline" />
<Image src={import("../images/aep/6.jpg")} alt="" class="inline" />

Anyways, there are still ~13 screenshots of him asking every day about how to do that…

## ECS REVIVAL AND AEP

So aep is claiming that I have owned a project X revival, here is the proof that I didn't…

<Image src={import("../images/aep/7.jpg")} alt="" />

Yes, Samuel was the real owner of project X.

<Image src={import("../images/aep/8.png")} alt="" />

Aep is claiming to never skidded even if he admitted multiple times:

<Image src={import("../images/aep/9.jpg")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/aep/10.png")} alt="" />

As you can see, aep is claiming ecs (economy simulator) source is his own source from scratch

## RACISM AND AEP

Aep is some edgy 15yo who loves acting very immature

<Image src={import("../images/aep/11.png")} alt="" />

Yes, Aep has been doxxed by someone from the sbc (sandbox community) when he was not in the orc (I won't leak the dox because I'm not supporting those things even if he did bad things)

## DISCORD ACCOUNT HACKING AND AEP

<Image src={import("../images/aep/12.png")} alt="" />

Aep loves "beaming" Discord accounts for no reason, yeah aep has a lot of aliases and he was also called "iron"

<Image src={import("../images/aep/13.png")} alt="" /> another hacked account

average Aep moment looking at void src (he is talking about it everydays, bro fr need to stop skidding lmao)

<Image src={import("../images/aep/14.png")} alt="" />

Aep and his friend tried to dox my friend, hopefully I told him about the current situation and he deleted all of his account before they get his location (because this was possible), ofc aep deleted all of his message about my friend

<Image src={import("../images/aep/15.png")} alt="" />
<Image src={import("../images/aep/16.png")} alt="" />

I hope after his Aep and his shitty ass ego will leave the orc lmao

<Image src={import("../images/aep/17.png")} alt="" />

We are also suspecting Aep skidding void mac endpoint because he released mac once void src has been leaked which is weird.

Btw funny thing about Aep, he tried to save his ass (cuz he knew I'll make this doc) by AGAIN spreading misinformations

<Image src={import("../images/aep/18.png")} alt="" />

Last info abt Aep is don't join fossci, his shit isn't that "very secure"  
Imma show why later but I'd suggest everyone who joined fossci to leave it and never join it back

More info at: https://discord.gg/urTrBHAcYW Btw: (I did it ofc, Aep)
